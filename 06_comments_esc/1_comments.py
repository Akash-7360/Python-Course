1. Java Packages

A package is a group of related classes, interfaces, and sub-packages.

They can be of two types:

Built-in packages → Provided by Java (e.g., java.lang, java.util, java.sql, javax.swing, java.io, java.net, etc.).

User-defined packages → Created by programmers for organizing their own classes.
